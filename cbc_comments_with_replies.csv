5642500019888,Thomas M. Smith,"In this time of crises, we are our own worst enemies. Those individuals failing to practice self-isolation and putting others at risk are the worst of all. Their actions, or inactions, create fear and the government acts to control public fear by invoking new more restrictive measures until they have control of the situation. Our government can, and unfortunately will, invoke whatever measures they feel are necessary to control the public, including spying on its citizens to determine compliance with its rules that were created out of fear. Once the privacy erosion is in train out of fear, we have lost."

9098800019880,gordon shumway,Data plans are expensive and I'm sure many people are like me and have limited data plans on their phones. Supposedly tracking exact location by cell tower is problematic. Will legislation be required to make sure everyone has their GPS and location services turned on?

Robert David Graham of Errata Security points out to the intricacies of the terms “off”, “track”, and “phone”. “The best way to track an ‘off’ phone is to — secretly — install a chip, connected to the phone’s battery supply” says, Graham. “Thus, even when the phone is ‘off,’ that added chip would still be ‘on.’ In this case, it’s not really the phone itself that’s being tracked, but that chip.“.

I know that will sound offensive to some because who the hell is the state anyway to know what ""I'm"" up to?  Trouble is it isn't the state's fault entirely.  We're all victims of a trend to invent new technologies without ever so much as a ""no never mind"" about what it leads to consequentially.  And I blame ourselves, though that too may not be particularly popular.  Every citizen has the power to put questions to their government - that won't change soon - and if enough of us ask, the politicians might get the idea in their head taking something too far might not be a good idea.

And then there are the upsides to the technologies we use to consider too.  Apart from convenience, there are applications for the ""track citizens"" tech in many different industries ranging from medicine to travel to climate, etc.  That list is lengthy; so before going and blaming ""the Liberal Party"" for all ails us, maybe we should think on that too.

And hold on to your hats folks, 'cuz its only getting worse.  The same recent breakthroughs in neural technology that let the deaf hear and speak (along with other applications for the disabled) can be used on you too in the years ahead.  That has plusses and minuses worthy of consideration in a world where suitcase nukes that are hidden covertly by monied interests abroad need to be considered at some point, in my view.

Like it or not, Canada is part of a world pandemic right now.  The PM, provincial premiers and federal and provincial health authorities are pleading with Canadians to stay home as much as possible and, if they go out, to practice things like social distancing.  Given the circumstances, if someone decides to be an idiot and ignore what's being asked, then I think in current times our governments could make an easy argument in the Courts to suspend those rights for those who jeopardize their fellow Canadians.

8963400020140,Brian Acton,"This is getting ridiculous... the biggest threat that the goverment is willing to consider is to track people via their cell phone?? What about a real quarantine -- people these days, especially those serving in government, seem to have forgotten the meaning of the word ""quarantine"". Here's my definition: ""A quarantine is a segregated area where people -- who are infected with a microbe that if transmitted among the population at large could eventually result in the deaths of millions of people around the world -- are kept under guard by the government, and may not leave that area until they are no longer considered to be infectious."" 
Obviously we need _real_ quarantines to be initiated on a large scale across this country, and we've needed them for weeks now, especially at border entry points. Instead we get this ""if you don't self-isolate well... um maybe we might say something mean about you"" kind of attitude from the goverment. 
Look at it this way. Under the provisions of Bill C-46, the notorious constitutionally-unfriendly legislation passed by this same goverment, you can be arrested while sitting by your swimming pool after driving home hours earlier, because someone (perhaps someone who wished you harm) told the cops that you were drinking earlier that day. So the government will go that far to catch the last 10% of drunk drivers but when it comes to a threat that's a few orders of magnitude larger than the few remaining drunk drivers out there, it's ""Don't be too harsh with people, you know civil liberties are always paramount"" (which is never true during any serious national crisis -- let's face it -- and often for good reasons). So the reluctance to put people into a real quarantine, which is far less onerous than jail. Is hard for me to understand."

Procedurally, the Cabinet must present its proclamation of an emergency to Parliament within seven sitting days. If Parliament stands adjourned – as the House of Commons and the Senate presently do – then both Houses must be summoned back into session within seven days. The House of Commons and the Senate must each debate and then vote to confirm the proclamation. If either the House of Commons or the Senate does not ratify the proclamation, then it is revoked effective that day.

So, let's stop the Liberal bashing about the Emergencies Act, because if it is enforced all parties would have their hands in the pot so to speak."

What the story says is that other countries are using cellphone data to track people who break the quaranine rules. It cites a number of countries doing that. When Trudeau was asked if Canada is considering that, Trudeau replied that it was not something they are considering at this time. 

Technically, you could argue that response is ""leaving the door open"" but it is a bizarre headline of course he can't absolutely, 100 per cent exclude it. It would irresponsible for him to sayn that under NO circumstances would Canada do that even if the epedemic is spreading astronomically and people who are already testing positive are breaking the quarntien rules and deliberately going around infecting others????

So of course he is going to ""leave the door open"" if the situation is dire, as anybody should, but he is saying that at  this time, that is not under consideration."
4887700019805,Brett Chandler,"I'm an IT professional and I have no problem with this at all. In fact, many of us are already taking part in mobile data aggregation voluntarily.

One example, the Waze traffic app. App users are sending location data back all the time. If a group of users are on a freeway, and a clump start to slow down, the app alerts drivers further down the road of congestion. No personally-identifiable data is sent, but there's a collective public benefit.

This is the kind of data they're talking about. Getting non-personal location data to see if large groups of people are gathering in public. A clump is detected, the authorities are sent around to break it up because people are too dumb to listen to common sense.

The data use needs to be transparent and the rules need to be public, but if they do that I'm fine with it."

You want to take the car .. many cars turn off the stereo, and have trackers and so on that report when TOLERANCES  are violated in speed, area travelled and so on.

The weakness of the rules is that endless exceptions exist such as necessary shopping, therefore the numbers of people to monitor ALL data and decipher what has meaning and what doesn't, is endless.

The CPC have been making lots of noise since before 2015, and where did making all that noise get them?

Just commenting on this site sends more data about you than an aggregate of data ever could.

For individuals, anyone that needs to be tracked can be given an ankle bracelet.  That would be within the current authority of the local health officer and would be supported by a court order.  Much more reliable than a smart phone that can either be turned off or simply left on at home."

The masks you see in most pictures from abroad are for air quality reasons.  They are good at stopping large airborne particles.  No so much viral infections.

But a trouble with masks is always in removing them without infecting yourself with your hands.  Most people don't even know how to take masks or gloves off properly so their use by the general population is of limited benefit."

A lemming would fail to recognize these details of fact, and attempt to spin this as a partisan issue, when it really is about a balance of privacy versus the greater social good.
