I know that will sound offensive to some because who the hell is the state anyway to know what ""I'm"" up to?  Trouble is it isn't the state's fault entirely.  We're all victims of a trend to invent new technologies without ever so much as a ""no never mind"" about what it leads to consequentially.  And I blame ourselves, though that too may not be particularly popular.  Every citizen has the power to put questions to their government - that won't change soon - and if enough of us ask, the politicians might get the idea in their head taking something too far might not be a good idea.

And then there are the upsides to the technologies we use to consider too.  Apart from convenience, there are applications for the ""track citizens"" tech in many different industries ranging from medicine to travel to climate, etc.  That list is lengthy; so before going and blaming ""the Liberal Party"" for all ails us, maybe we should think on that too.

And hold on to your hats folks, 'cuz its only getting worse.  The same recent breakthroughs in neural technology that let the deaf hear and speak (along with other applications for the disabled) can be used on you too in the years ahead.  That has plusses and minuses worthy of consideration in a world where suitcase nukes that are hidden covertly by monied interests abroad need to be considered at some point, in my view.

8963400020140,Brian Acton,"This is getting ridiculous... the biggest threat that the goverment is willing to consider is to track people via their cell phone?? What about a real quarantine -- people these days, especially those serving in government, seem to have forgotten the meaning of the word ""quarantine"". Here's my definition: ""A quarantine is a segregated area where people -- who are infected with a microbe that if transmitted among the population at large could eventually result in the deaths of millions of people around the world -- are kept under guard by the government, and may not leave that area until they are no longer considered to be infectious."" 
Obviously we need _real_ quarantines to be initiated on a large scale across this country, and we've needed them for weeks now, especially at border entry points. Instead we get this ""if you don't self-isolate well... um maybe we might say something mean about you"" kind of attitude from the goverment. 
Look at it this way. Under the provisions of Bill C-46, the notorious constitutionally-unfriendly legislation passed by this same goverment, you can be arrested while sitting by your swimming pool after driving home hours earlier, because someone (perhaps someone who wished you harm) told the cops that you were drinking earlier that day. So the government will go that far to catch the last 10% of drunk drivers but when it comes to a threat that's a few orders of magnitude larger than the few remaining drunk drivers out there, it's ""Don't be too harsh with people, you know civil liberties are always paramount"" (which is never true during any serious national crisis -- let's face it -- and often for good reasons). So the reluctance to put people into a real quarantine, which is far less onerous than jail. Is hard for me to understand.",Negative,1

The House of Commons and the Senate must each debate and then vote to confirm the proclamation.

What the story says is that other countries are using cellphone data to track people who break the quaranine rules. It cites a number of countries doing that. When Trudeau was asked if Canada is considering that, Trudeau replied that it was not something they are considering at this time. 

Technically, you could argue that response is ""leaving the door open"" but it is a bizarre headline of course he can't absolutely, 100 per cent exclude it. It would irresponsible for him to sayn that under NO circumstances would Canada do that even if the epedemic is spreading astronomically and people who are already testing positive are breaking the quarntien rules and deliberately going around infecting others????

4887700019805,Brett Chandler,"I'm an IT professional and I have no problem with this at all. In fact, many of us are already taking part in mobile data aggregation voluntarily.

One example, the Waze traffic app. App users are sending location data back all the time. If a group of users are on a freeway, and a clump start to slow down, the app alerts drivers further down the road of congestion. No personally-identifiable data is sent, but there's a collective public benefit.

This is the kind of data they're talking about. Getting non-personal location data to see if large groups of people are gathering in public. A clump is detected, the authorities are sent around to break it up because people are too dumb to listen to common sense.
