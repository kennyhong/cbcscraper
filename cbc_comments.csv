1.46E+12,leonard g MacAulay,"The govt does not need a reason to impose Orwellian surveillance laws, just an excuse ."
3.85E+12,Johnathon Locke,Why are so many celebs getting it?
5.64E+12,Thomas M. Smith,"In this time of crises, we are our own worst enemies. Those individuals failing to practice self-isolation and putting others at risk are the worst of all. Their actions, or inactions, create fear and the government acts to control public fear by invoking new more restrictive measures until they have control of the situation. Our government can, and unfortunately will, invoke whatever measures they feel are necessary to control the public, including spying on its citizens to determine compliance with its rules that were created out of fear. Once the privacy erosion is in train out of fear, we have lost."
1.01E+13,Andy Briars,just keep being polite as the virus keeps spreading. this is noncompliance from grown adults putting lives at risk just how bad does it have to get
3.86E+12,Chuck Michaels,Imagine... an ankle monitoring bracelet that YOU pay for yourself....

7.69E+12,Robert Anderson,"Trudeau and all the millennials probably do not know it, but smart phones actually have an off switch. It works like the Romulan cloaking device... Millennials won't know about that one either!"
1.33E+12,Eugene Eklund,This is a slippery slope I don't think we want to go down!
7.73E+12,Wilhelm Mux,"That's not what he said, Catherine...

(Pretty bad when CBC spreading false news...)"
3.36E+12,Henri Bianchi,"I have a flip phone on a prepaid plan that I rarely even turn on - emergencies and to coordinate the car when my wife and I are in two different locations.  

Life does not require that you walk down the street hunched over as you scroll your way through twitter, email and text messages.  

However, apparently this makes it harder for big brother to track where I am."
7.97E+12,Red Tarnek,Big Brother is Watching You
6.62E+12,ralph jacobs,I feel more threatened by people who may have been exposed to the virus walking around then by the government wondering where I am going.
1.04E+13,Graham Smith,Only 13 countries with more confirmed cases than Canada. That's out of 172 countries affected. I's say Canada is doing a poor job all around. Spending more time worrying about money than controlling the spread.
1.20E+12,sian maccauley,"Here we have it, folks - Justin's ""Just watch me"" moment. Happy, Liberals?"
4.47E+12,Brian Woodley,Like the government is not using this already.
1.09E+13,Mark Eldridge,This government is relentless in its pursuit of control. First trying to control the government by granting itself a 21-month rule over our money and now using our phones to follow us. Scary!
8.41E+12,sian maccauley,Dr. Tam citing ethics while Trudeau is her boss. That's rich.
7.44E+12,Peter Ray,"Unless the telco's agree to ALL share and provide REAL-TIME monitoring of actual calls/texts - if the capacity even exists to do so - geo-location can be disabled.

Just tell them you let someone borrow your phone! Or will the new Canadian dictatorship make that illegal during - and likely after - this manufactured crisis?"
2.19E+12,ralph jacobs,If you are not a carrier of the virus you have no worries of being tracked . If you are a carrier then you should be at home and have no fear of being tracked.
1.91E+12,dave colledge,"Thru out history a number of inventions were to be good for people but they only turned out to be good for the government to oppress people further , the phnes are turning out as history forecast ."
4.34E+12,John Noble,"No , no and no !  Libs just cannot let a good crisis go wanting! 
We are NOT a Police state .  We are literally weeks away from major civil unrest I. One way or another."
6.51E+12,TonyMasters,Trudeau can't help himself but to use the pandemic for a power grab.  It is really disgusting behaviour in my opinion.
2.88E+12,Marie Gilbert,"I don’t remember willfully consenting to any of this as a Canadian. Never polled, never asked, just shoved down my throat. This is basically the beginnings of a  dictator's police state."
3.86E+12,David John,Just leave your phone at home when you go out. Or roll it in lead foil. I'm not sure how this will stop anything. Who will monitor the phones of these people?
2.64E+12,Randy A. Selkirk,Trudeau leaves the door open ! Is this in reference to the virus with no passport ?
1.54E+12,john hill,Next he'll be getting us micro-chipped. George Orwell wrote a book about this.
5.83E+12,Randy A. Selkirk,Now the virus has ethics !
9.10E+12,gordon shumway,Data plans are expensive and I'm sure many people are like me and have limited data plans on their phones. Supposedly tracking exact location by cell tower is problematic. Will legislation be required to make sure everyone has their GPS and location services turned on?
9.67E+12,David McCallum,"If we use GPS, Google Maps, ask Alexa and others for recommendation of restaurants close by and a whole host of other everyday situations then your location is being shared by you for trivial reasons. Now we have a life saving reason to track locations and, since it is government wanting to track us, some of us are getting our noses out of joint? Frankly if I am a law abiding citizen in a democratic country (and recent events in Ottawa suggest we still are) and not in a malevolent dictatorship, I have no problem being tracked. There may a time when this saves my life but currently it could save the lives of others"
5.31E+12,Jeff Trueman,Big brother is watching. Yet people complain that China spies on it's people. Unreal
1.54E+12,Robert Brannen,I am wondering how the 2013 amendment to section 66 of the Criminal Code of Canada now applies to the COVID-19 situation in cases of persons congregating in groups larger than allowed.
3.18E+12,ralph jacobs,I don't agree with Trudeau on many things he's done but I can support him on this. If people on their own won't do anything on jeaprodising health of others then government has to step in.
5.47E+12,Robert Brannen,"For the enlightenment of ""Freddy Rush"", and his like:

Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, was born in Hong Kong when Hong Kong was a British Colony and grew up in the United Kingdom. She received her medical training from the University of Nottingham, the University of Alberta and the University of British Columbia."
5.04E+12,Wayne Ingman,"It frustrates me that in the lack of swabs and serious testing, the shortage of virtually everything and the reliance on social distancing and self isolation, we are only now starting to clamp down. Are we learning from Italy or imitating them?"
9.99E+12,ralph jacobs,It doesn't bother me as much for the government to know where I am as it does for them to know how much I earn.
4.91E+12,Marcus Aetuis,"This should pass with no problems, if history has shown us for so long now Canadians have little regard for their individual freedoms and would welcome any restrictions so long as you make the claim that it is for their own safety........"
2.19E+12,dave colledge,"According to data the Hong Kong flu killed about a million, this flu had a death 5 OF .5 , That calculates to about 200 million being affected., Was there this kind of noise?"
3.10E+12,Ian Chovil,"I was just looking at a cell phone data map of social distancing in the US in the Washington Post. It varies a lot from state to state. Wyoming is the least compliant. I have never needed a cell phone, and don't want one. I guess I'm a free man. People are starting to get upset at the economic losses they are experiencing. They are doing their own cost benefit analysis. They are like Trump. Is this worth it? The streets are empty. The stores are empty. A lot of people are running in my neighborhood. All the gyms are closed. Probably a good idea if you're feeling somewhat stressed."
5.61E+12,Wayne Ingman,"Do that, it is for the good in a war situation like this, but first 'please' get serious about screening of people coming into the country. Take temperatures, prevent mixing sick and well on flights. ... Too late probably, I shake my head."
2.17E+12,John Squire,"Trudeau is following the Chinese which are using the app. ""tick tock"" to enslave and follow all citizens ....... Doing this is against all freedoms and democracy into an authoritarian regime against the WILL of the people ...."
1.07E+13,STONEY MACARONI,"I ship out spray paint and flagging to construction companies and am deemed an essential worker and need to go to work and break self isolation and now we are all facing a lay off from our company to ""save money in this trying time for billion $ corporations"" .....this is a joke.

Oh and we will cut your Hydro $20 a month to help you out too."
9.59E+12,Ashley Kelly,"""Trudeau leaves door open to using smartphone data to track Canadians' compliance with pandemic rules""

For many of you your jaw will drop at the very thought of this but there are actually some of us that can leave the house, get in our cars and drive miles from home without our cell phone. And we don't even panic when we realize we don't have it."
6.78E+12,Keith Newcastle,So are people who want to ignore the stay at home order so clueless or so addicted to their phones?  What stops them from leaving the house without their phones?
4.31E+12,Pat Kenney,I don't have a smart phone
7.99E+12,George Moore,They do that already on a daily basis did no one listen to Snowden?
9.88E+12,Cory Crete,"And what of those tracked that are deemed ""Essential"" employment?   In ON almost everyone is declared Essential thanks to Ford taking half measures pretty much allowing anyone employer who wants to stay open to be open.   So monitoring thousands of people that are forced to work.. Heck my spouse works in ""essential service"" doing tech support for Apple devices, when she asked them for a danger pay raise of $1/hour temporarily - since she has to risk her life walking through a mall just to get to her employer with apartment rentals in the same building with no automatic open doors meaning everyone touches the handles and they don't clean the doors or windows - they laughed at her, couldn't believe she had ""the nerve"" to ask for $ (she only makes $15/hour), and threaten to terminate her even though Ford said no employer should be intimidating during this time.   I tell you nothing like a crises to show how crap people can be."
7.56E+12,Al Heywood,Big brother Justin is tracking you.
2.76E+12,Ashley Kelly,"The issue was thrust into the Canadian spotlight this morning after Toronto Mayor John Tory mused about obtaining cellphone data from wireless companies to locate large gatherings.

Just wondering. Has Tory ever formally apologized for risking peoples lives by encouraging them to eat in Toronto's Little China at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis?"
7.82E+12,Martin Caine,"Responsibility is the price of freedom, and it seems that responsibility is not a human trait:
One third of humanity under virus lockdown, More than 2.6 billion people around the world now face some form of restriction on their movements."
3.42E+12,Gord Moore,Maybe the Trudeau government would love to permanently track Canadians for any activity they don't agree with?
5.59E+12,Dirk Kohler,"The wife and I embrace it, shut the darn things off and throw them in the drawer. We where just laughing over coffee, imagine that used to go on 2 week motorcycle tours and maybe check in 2-3 times via pay phone. Not really that long ago and if you truly think that this world or you can't function without this tech then you are truly lost. It is a mere convenience....."
3.08E+12,ralph jacobs,"It is to bad that people force our government to think of things like this. If you are sick you should stay home and not infect your friends and neighbors. Just like those people who are masking symptoms to get on a plane, very inconsiderate and thoughtless."
8.05E+12,dave colledge,"Has anyone watched newsfootage recorded and later watched it on the news . You even wonder if they were at the same event . This is different , why?"
6.76E+12,Gentle Wong,"Unfortunately, Mr. Trudeau is good as a MP but not a PM. He's a friend to Chicom."
5.24E+12,Brian Matheis,But I thought Big Brother Canada was cancelled for 2020
7.40E+12,james tayler,"I've seen many giving lots of distance, what gets me is touching stuff. I was in a store early morning to avoid crowds.  Nothing to clean the cart with, cashier touching money and produce etc...  this virus lives on stuff for 24hrs inside from what I heard, outside it probably doesn't like  all that much.   It would be nice to see some maps of where to go if you have symptoms away from hospitals - isolation units and quarentine areas if the need arises.    
I don't think a smart phone app will do much, people won't bring their phone.
And, why test now.  People will fear testing if they may face jail time or ostracized.  

And, why are buses still running.  That has huge contamination risks!!  come down to risk assessment and contamination probabilities.    Buses are huge!  yet, they still operate!"
1.09E+13,JohnColford,A lot of heavy breathing here.
8.63E+12,Jan Böhmermann (the real one),"Resorting to such extreme measures of individual tracking, should not be the driver just because the technology exists, but what ultimate goal... or better to say, how this is going to benefit the (pandemic) situation... I don't believe much, so let's forget about the whole nonsense...  : )"
7.63E+12,dave colledge,Taken safe consensus in following the herd is very unwise. We are allowing government and paid media ramp up general hysteria . Remember the herd will run of a cliff.
1.08E+13,Kelly McMahon,"Trudeau never undid Harpers domestic spying garbage, and now follows him down the path to authoritarian police state."

5.84E+12,Robert Brannen,"Time for the Western, Social Credit-Conservatives to abandon the merged Conservative Party of Canada and allow a truly conservative party to redevelop.

2.57E+12,ericsson leaf,not so long ago Trudeau  was Doubles Down On Refusal To Close Borders As Coronavirus was Spreading
1.01E+13,Drew Wells,"Tracking Switched off phones with dedicated chips

Robert David Graham of Errata Security points out to the intricacies of the terms “off”, “track”, and “phone”. “The best way to track an ‘off’ phone is to — secretly — install a chip, connected to the phone’s battery supply” says, Graham. “Thus, even when the phone is ‘off,’ that added chip would still be ‘on.’ In this case, it’s not really the phone itself that’s being tracked, but that chip.“. In layman terms, this should probably explain why the USA banned networking companies like Huawei and ZTE"
8.86E+12,Rob Munson,"Doesn't it seem as though cabin fever has set in at the Trudeau palace? Our king is now using his front porch or steps to come out everyday and make new decrees over his domain. Mostly not very well thought out decrees and his subjects, serfs and lords alike, may one day start to revolt. As provinces are closing public houses and laying off their jokers, in order to keep social distancing rules in place, our lordship is still only demanding that we meet in groups no larger than fifty souls at a time. Of course, that decree is only for the commoner as he allowed only, was it 36, of his closet fellowship members into his courtyard to try and usurp our democracy with a couple of hidden gems inside an aid package. Beware all you peasants and peons, the king is in one of his moods and may strip you of your limited rights while he rules by decree. He, so far, seems fond of this new way of getting his demands out to his large dominion."

Stop being so selfish."
6.60E+12,Tommy Gunn,Mobile phone companies already share your personal data. They've been doing so since the invention of the cellular phone. Just leave your precious smart phone at home or turn it off when travelling. I hardly carry mine but then again I'm not a millennial or teenage girl.
2.89E+12,Stan Johnston,Going to have to take hard look at this. There are points for both sides.

One metre spacing, hand hygiene, not touching my face, plus a few others, like not touching stuff and washing everything that comes into my home.

4.71E+12,Matthew Sauer,"Well looks like I gotta stop using my phone. People... yes this virus is bad, no it's not the worst virus to had been on this earth. But if you're going to let the government see where you are, or what you are doing based off your phone, you are 100% supporting a non free government. And a government that doesn't let you make any choices. To me that can have a far worse effect on Canada and the world. It's almost like the government wanted this to happen. More control. And if this comes into effect, I'm throwing my phone in the river."
2.51E+12,adam varga,"How will this benefit the people? Its not like they are prepared to share movement maps of confirmed infected cases. If anything the government response has done little too late. Why have they not shut down public transit, why do they mislead people to think if you stay away from people your going to be ok. the virus lives on surfaces for 3-30 days. its enough for one infected person to touch a handrail and anyone for the next couple days who touches this could get infected. Why have they not created guidelines that say you have to wear gloves and masks when your in public."

8.45E+12,Gam Clarendon,It is a naive notion. People who don't buy in will just go off the grid if phones are monitored. The phone will prove they haven't left the house while they do what they want.
9.82E+12,toby mockler,The Charter of Rights includes people who are not  Canadian or who have never set foot in Canada but somehow the government is free to track your phone movements and act on that tracking? What if somebody else is using your phone? Huge Pandora's Box.
4.68E+12,Peter Fair,"This is becoming a war folks and the “irresponsible” among us are the enemy. If you are one of those and continue to ignore information and government directives your freedom to do so is going to be eliminated and will come with personal repercussions.  

Our governments have been very polite, the Canadian way, in the belief that the Canadian populace is responsible, cooperative and will act accordingly in the effort to defeat this virus. With community spread now escalating it is evident that requests by the Government have been ignored by the irresponsible and reckless few in the populace. 

As a result the rights of all of us are now threatened. Next will be your “papers”. This is already happening in other countries. When you’re asked by police or military to “show your papers”, you’d best not be out and about where you aren’t supposed to be.
In times of crisis, governments have many tools available as JT has stated on numerous occasions. Keep flaunting and testing this and you will find out."

I am a Western Canadian, BC, and a Conservative all my life. But this report is very blunt and misleading in it's heading. It is not fair to MY Prime Minister or to Canadians reading it. 
It is not that there is not a slight flavor of truth to it. It is that it is too B&W without explanation and assumes way too much about something in the possible future that will likely never be."

I know that will sound offensive to some because who the hell is the state anyway to know what ""I'm"" up to?  Trouble is it isn't the state's fault entirely.  We're all victims of a trend to invent new technologies without ever so much as a ""no never mind"" about what it leads to consequentially.  And I blame ourselves, though that too may not be particularly popular.  Every citizen has the power to put questions to their government - that won't change soon - and if enough of us ask, the politicians might get the idea in their head taking something too far might not be a good idea.

And then there are the upsides to the technologies we use to consider too.  Apart from convenience, there are applications for the ""track citizens"" tech in many different industries ranging from medicine to travel to climate, etc.  That list is lengthy; so before going and blaming ""the Liberal Party"" for all ails us, maybe we should think on that too.

And hold on to your hats folks, 'cuz its only getting worse.  The same recent breakthroughs in neural technology that let the deaf hear and speak (along with other applications for the disabled) can be used on you too in the years ahead.  That has plusses and minuses worthy of consideration in a world where suitcase nukes that are hidden covertly by monied interests abroad need to be considered at some point, in my view.

So it isn't just about the Liberals now, is it?

Can the data be abused?  Kid yourself not - it can be.  The question to ask here then is: what assurances can we the people be given it won't be?"

8.96E+12,Brian Acton,"This is getting ridiculous... the biggest threat that the goverment is willing to consider is to track people via their cell phone?? What about a real quarantine -- people these days, especially those serving in government, seem to have forgotten the meaning of the word ""quarantine"". Here's my definition: ""A quarantine is a segregated area where people -- who are infected with a microbe that if transmitted among the population at large could eventually result in the deaths of millions of people around the world -- are kept under guard by the government, and may not leave that area until they are no longer considered to be infectious."" 
Obviously we need _real_ quarantines to be initiated on a large scale across this country, and we've needed them for weeks now, especially at border entry points. Instead we get this ""if you don't self-isolate well... um maybe we might say something mean about you"" kind of attitude from the goverment. 
Look at it this way. Under the provisions of Bill C-46, the notorious constitutionally-unfriendly legislation passed by this same goverment, you can be arrested while sitting by your swimming pool after driving home hours earlier, because someone (perhaps someone who wished you harm) told the cops that you were drinking earlier that day. So the government will go that far to catch the last 10% of drunk drivers but when it comes to a threat that's a few orders of magnitude larger than the few remaining drunk drivers out there, it's ""Don't be too harsh with people, you know civil liberties are always paramount"" (which is never true during any serious national crisis -- let's face it -- and often for good reasons). So the reluctance to put people into a real quarantine, which is far less onerous than jail. Is hard for me to understand."

Procedurally, the Cabinet must present its proclamation of an emergency to Parliament within seven sitting days. If Parliament stands adjourned – as the House of Commons and the Senate presently do – then both Houses must be summoned back into session within seven days. The House of Commons and the Senate must each debate and then vote to confirm the proclamation. If either the House of Commons or the Senate does not ratify the proclamation, then it is revoked effective that day.

So, let's stop the Liberal bashing about the Emergencies Act, because if it is enforced all parties would have their hands in the pot so to speak."

Technically, you could argue that response is ""leaving the door open"" but it is a bizarre headline of course he can't absolutely, 100 per cent exclude it. It would irresponsible for him to sayn that under NO circumstances would Canada do that even if the epedemic is spreading astronomically and people who are already testing positive are breaking the quarntien rules and deliberately going around infecting others????

4.89E+12,Brett Chandler,"I'm an IT professional and I have no problem with this at all. In fact, many of us are already taking part in mobile data aggregation voluntarily.

One example, the Waze traffic app. App users are sending location data back all the time. If a group of users are on a freeway, and a clump start to slow down, the app alerts drivers further down the road of congestion. No personally-identifiable data is sent, but there's a collective public benefit.

This is the kind of data they're talking about. Getting non-personal location data to see if large groups of people are gathering in public. A clump is detected, the authorities are sent around to break it up because people are too dumb to listen to common sense.

The data use needs to be transparent and the rules need to be public, but if they do that I'm fine with it."

Governments are exceptionally good at rolling out legislation for ""security"" reasons....not so good at clawing them back....see 9/11, and it's aftermath"
8.81E+12,Roger Stanley,"Hey CBC, your boy Justin is taking a hit on here.  Time to deflect.  Tell us again what YOU think Andrew Scheers views are on ssm and abortion.  That should work for a while."
8.74E+12,Jeremy Karkheck,This is how China controls it's population....No thanks I'll turn my phone off.
8.55E+12,Gordon Jenkins,"COVID-19 is Endemic in Quebec.  Social distancing and self isolation is now utterly pointless.  That window of prevention is now closed.  Time to get the manufacturing machine from stand-by to fast idle and slow to moderate speed by the end of May.  Political Power Grabs don't fly in a post 9/11 World. By keeping stores open that sell tobacco products, health is obviously not the objective, but the means to power. Power is the true colour of this beast."
5.66E+12,Ric Smith,Pretty soon they will be cross-referencing with the party member/donor database to see if they can give you a pass or not.
9.03E+12,Roger Stanley,"Uh Justin, cell phones have on and off buttons."
3.87E+12,Louis Pelt,"Things will never be quite the same after Covid-19. They might return to ""normal"", but it's going to be a new normal. The crisis produced by this pathogen is an inherent psychological test that has already exposed aspects about individuals, organizations, and governments that they'd rather people not know."

1.17E+12,Dan Pantages,"If this helps fighting the virus I have no problem with it.  My wife and I have done 10 days of a 14 day isolation.  When it's over one of us will have to go to the grocery store and get some fresh vegetables, plus prescriptions.  Are we going to be fined for leaving the house, I'm sure not.  We're all in the together and if you're a doubter I don't want you any where near me or my family and friends."
4.88E+12,John Fairview,Please track people and make it legal for the police to stop and search anyone who looks like they don't belong in an office park. I'm seeing some very concerning things.
6.95E+12,Ken Van de Burgt,"Hammering the Curve means aggressively testing, tracking, tracing, isolating and quarantine of people infected and then sharing information with the public. 

No ethical values can trump these measures.

I don't have a cell phone but if tracking people's movements can help hammer the curve then it should be understood as civic duty instead of an intrusion on privacy. Get over it and do it! Now."

8.18E+12,Jacky Wang,or just let people get sick..only 1% don't make it.
6.28E+12,Chris Smith,Amazed at how many people are abhorred to give information to government or be tracked during a time of need but on the other hand willingly give immense amounts of data including locations everyday to private corporations whose sole interest is to sell that data for their own gain.

1.09E+13,Ray Bungay,I have an iPhone 6s with no data plan. I have the location finder turned off as well as the GPS disabled. Problem solved a Mr PM not that at 73 I am out all the time not. The time I was out was last Thursday to our Superstore for groceries. Cheers!

3.21E+12,Peter Weber,Charter of Rights do not matter to this liberal government Break all rules when it suits them Lackey monopoly corporations willing to suck up to the government

3.81E+12,Roger Shrubber,"Wow, who knew that Big Brother would arrive in the form of a snowboard instructor!"
6.37E+12,Ben Freeland,Well that is all genuinely horrifying.
8.08E+12,Abe Fukumaya,None of these would be necessary if the PM had made an announcement in late February that our healthcare would not cover anyone who leaved the country in March and returned with the virus.
2.33E+12,JP Paul Maxwell,Oh No your not Vladimir.
1.81E+12,Robert Marks,A million Canadians returned home from other countries in the last week.  Each with an unknown potential to do harm. Tracking them sounds like a conservative idea to me.
1.75E+12,James Fitzgibbon ,This is how China beat the virus so quickly. It is an essential tool in tracking the disease.
9.76E+12,Abe Fukumaya,"Put a smart footcuff on each returnee. That is the only way. Another way is to impose a fine of $50,000 on each returnee caught breaking the quarantine."
4.53E+12,Basil Masse,Won't work ... shut it off and remove battery.
2.20E+12,Abe Fukumaya,No use. The phone stays home and the owner is out there spreading the virus.
7.80E+12,Edward Teach,Try it and I'll attach my phone to my dog's collar and send him outside to play.  Have fun tracking him.
5.47E+12,Abe Fukumaya,One phrase for those of you who have just returned from spring break and plan not to observe your quarantine: Shame on you.
9.46E+12,BobbyTaylor,"They'll have a hard time tracking my phone, it's attached to the wall in my house. But I am staying home except to walk the dog, walk the shelter dogs and volunteer at the animal shelter (the dogs and cats still need to be cared for). Several people in town walk their dogs but we are all staying well apart."
5.11E+12,Glen Toogood,"It's just called a ""Smartphone""."
3.47E+12,Teresa Mogensen,Leaving the door open to everything yet doing very little if anything. Always a delayed reaction. His provincial counterpart is no better. In a Main St strip mall today all stores were still open except for a few that closed of their own fruition last week. Bulk barn was open with all its exposed scoops but the bulk section at Walmart had been reportedly covered up.Piles of cars all over the extesive two block long parking lot. In the interim I am sure that many are waiting with baited breath for the incoming flights  from allover.
2.33E+12,Kevin Darroch,Frankly speaking in goodwill. Our police and judicial system at times cannot go after the officials who break the laws themselves?  Maybe that is because they make the laws and they break the laws? But they may or will be spying on us and use facial ID? And now where else is the so-called novel virus going!? Time to monitor by camera and microphone all the activities of our leaders perhaps? Or will they go two-faced and make a problem of denial?
7.00E+12,James Felding,I think this Liberal government is suffering from mental illness. What next? euthanize 5 percent of healthy people in an attempt to save the 1 percent at greatest risk of complications from Covid 19?  The cure will soon be worse than the disease. Its a Liberal knee jerkin festivus.
1.08E+13,Angelica West,How ridiculous. I've been a good and compliant citizen and this is the thanks I get. Time to leave our phones at home when we're out hiking in the woods and grocery shopping. How highly insulting.
5.92E+12,partha gogoi,"At the moment public heatlh is more important than privacy. It may go against the principles of liberal democracy, but sometimes we have to make hard choices. Do we have any other option, when faced with an emergency? thosands are dying daily, we cannot simply abandon the old and the vulnerable at this time. It is too great a price to pay"
9.24E+12,Daryl Diamond,"The government should AT LEAST collect and publish WiFi MAC addresses (not phone numbers, nor names), of infected individuals phones.
A simple iPhone or Android app can collect all WiFi MAC addresses in a persons' travels.
Then, if a MAC ID appears on the government list, the app can tell a person to self-isolate.

But you can't do anything unless the MAC addresses are published."
9.25E+12,Richard Fleming,"JT ""using smartphone data to track Canadians' compliance with pandemic rules""!!!
Isn't this exactly what the Canadian media about a mouth ago were badmouthing China did at the peak of her Wuhan pademic?

1.11E+12,Doug James,"The Star Wars prequels come to mind. In history when a government takes power for a crisis, it rarely reliquishes it when the crisis ends. The pandemic is a big deal, but we should be careful about the world we'll still have to live in when the dust settles."
4.79E+12,Tony Nobula,Who needs privacy
4.26E+12,Anna Greene,Funny how things shift...this is all OK and now facial recognition tech will be OK to prevent or attempt to spread COVID but heaven forbid the police or law enforcement try to use these techniques to assist in solving are preventing crime and there is hell to pay.
9.44E+12,Dave Hanson,Oh no!!! My freedom to congregate in groups during a pandemic (which I'm not supposed to be doing anyways) is being trampled upon!!! The horror!!!
3.56E+12,Drew Farrell,"As I've said before, the Libs are watered-down Conservatives at heart."

1.28E+12,Arnold Rimmer,"The whole reason the Emergency Measures Act  exists (and similar laws in most other countries) is to suspend normal rights and democratic processes in a time of emergency.  

In such times, for example, the government has the authority to restrict your normal rights to freedom of movement, even though you have done nothing wrong."

No net at home..no money for it
And pays lousy
Been a slice
See ya"
5.25E+12,Alan Law,"Ethical quandary ? We are way past that point.  Society, in general, has embraced the surveillance state.  Google Bell FB MS Amazon and all the rest are collecting more info about us that the govt could ever manage on its own.  They sell it to anyone, so sharing with the govt is no extra concern.
If you are really worried, turn off Location Services, or better still, leave the phone at home."

3.04E+12,Alan Smith,Target all those fools on the west coast hanging out on the Sea Wall.
1.09E+13,Bob Loblaw,"Watch as politicians use this pandemic as a way to erode our social liberties. I can picture them tenting their fingers and saying ""Excellent"".  They already tried to institute unlimited taxing power. I am very thankful Justin doesn't have a majority government."
1.46E+12,rhea smeltzer,"The options are: put aside your privacy rights temporarily, or let those who refuse to comply, spread the virus  endangering others and causing a prolongation. Of course, if you think like trump, a term I use loosely, you will simply scorn all medical and scientific data and insist the country be open for business by Easter, when all the churches will be packed..a beautiful thing, and people ""full of vim and vigour and energy"" ready to work"" .Thank God  I live in Canada."

4.59E+12,Roger devry,Soon we will be able to call a phone number and report our neighbours.

6.64E+12,Luc Newsome,Wait until It gets warmer.......it’s a long winter in Canada
8.35E+12,Mike McGegor,well we do have those  truck-mounted water cannons used for riot control they could spray those  disobeying to stay inside or not keeping safe distance of 2 meters with hand sanitizer.

9.05E+12,Dawn Carter,"“ Bell Canada has said it's willing to share personal information with governments if called upon.”

Glad I don’t have a bell account. 

Personally, I think this version of Pandora’s Box goes too far. If governments give themselves the right to invade privacy on this scale even once and it’s successful you can bet they’ll be back again under “other exceptional” circumstances."

9.85E+12,Rory Cain,Aside from Ebola the origin of every nasty bug seems to be the same place. Why is that?
6.56E+12,George Reid,Obviously JT is not in control anymore as he said they had removed the power grab from the bill yesterday and that it was just the badly needed stimulus package
7.49E+12,Lynn Green,"“When the Chinese government saw that information technology was becoming a part of daily life, it realized it would have a powerful new tool for both gathering information and controlling culture, for making Chinese people more ‘modern’ and more ‘governable’ - which have been perennial obsessions of the leadership.” ~ Julian Gewirtz (Harvard historian)

In 2013, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau admitted to having ""a level of admiration"" for China's ""basic dictatorship"", so today's announcement that ""all options are on the table to do what is necessary to keep Canadians safe in these exceptional times"" should surprise no one."
6.83E+12,Bob Loblaw,Some of you may find this difficult to believe but I can actually leave my house without my cell phone and I suspect others can as well.

4.29E+12,Rory Cain,Wow - I didn't know smart phones had proximity detectors to tell authorities others were near you!
5.97E+12,Philip Lucas,"Tracking smart phones will not work, as huge numbers of Albertans stock up on ammunition (why I really do not know, expected increase in vermin?) and have nearly exhausted the supply of pay as you go cell phones to avoid being tracked by the Liberal government.

Get a Liberal to suggest it!"
8.86E+12,Patrick Richard in QC (AKA Patrick Richard),"Remember the multiple attempts by the Conservatives to pass a bill to allow mass surveillance?  C-30 which morphed into C-13.

Remember C-30 (2012), originally titled Lawful Access Act aka the Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act?  Remember Vic Toews telling an opposition MP that he could ""either stand with us or with the child pornographers""?  Remember how C-30 did not mention children, or internet predators, other than in its title?

Remember C-13 (2013), short titled Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act?  Remember how the Liberals voted en bloc for C-13 in 2014?

If you voted Conservative or Liberal, you voted for C-13; you voted for surveillance.  Bravo."
5.40E+12,Chuck Anderson,"That's the most idiotic idea from Trudeau, yet.
Does this guy have an update on what his government is actually ""DOING"" to mitigate the spread of this virus and perhaps what they are doing to HELP Canadians get through this, ?"

4.47E+12,Adam Gajewski,Do not leave home without it ;-)
3.47E+12,Eevee Frost,I think Conservatives missed the point where they think they have a say.  They don't have enough votes to have a say.  On anything.  JT and Jag have a majority.  They are like minded.
9.34E+12,mike kennedy,Justin is the only family I know of with an active Covid19 case due to unnecessary travel.  Track her phone.
6.61E+12,Pauline Colerick,"Not a big fan of using phone tracking power as, even though there is potentially an argument for it as young people will definitely not leave home without their phone, it would be difficult to trust that the government would stop the practice when this was over."
2.94E+12,Heath Ward,Response to this:  will be turning the gps off and use a VPN to run off free wifi connections when out of my home.
5.09E+12,Eevee Frost,It's too bad the Conservatives don't have enough votes to influence the next 3.5 years in any way.  Sad.

7.81E+12,Ed Sager,Just turn your GPS locater off and your location can't be tracked. That also helps reduce those annoying ads that pop up on your smartphone and computer.
8.75E+12,James Sykes,"The only reason we need social distancing is because we don't have ventilators, doctors and supplies."
2.91E+12,Kate Young,"Someone here had mentioned fitting people diagnosed with Covid with trackable ankle bracelets to ensure compliance with quarantine and isolation measures...actually a great idea and a temporary measure. My worry with tracking the phones is that once that level of privacy,  for what it's worth, is gone, there's no stepping down from that. If people just self isolated and weren't so arrogant we wouldn't have to entertain these measures in the first place. People need to grow up very quickly here."
3.16E+12,Neil Austen,"I was afraid of this. When China locked down cities of millions, I was awed by the efficiency and efficacy of their efforts. People there took on the toll and now the virus is contained in their country. I just knew when it was time for Canada and the US to do the same, we would come up wanting and failing. Even now Trump is denying science and suggesting the economy is more important. You have Canadian Conservatives insisting on crowding people together during a Pandemic for a leadership convention. You just have to wonder what in the holy heavens is going on here.."

9.94E+12,Rollo Tomasi,"What is not understood by many is that the Government is like a parent; and the citizens are like children.  They ALLOW liberty to the kids normally, but once that liberty is being abused; just like any parent they are quick to roll that liberty in .. take away the car keys, put in curfews and specify ""the rules"" that need to be kept too.  You want to take the car .. many cars turn off the stereo, and have trackers and so on that report when TOLERANCES  are violated in speed, area travelled and so on. CBC is giving license for over 2 months now showing how unfair the restrictions are for the kids really .. time to stop that and give the parents back the power .. oh surprise surprise .. they actually have."

9.30E+12,D P,"This is a horribly written clickbait article if I've ever seen one, perhaps one of the most disturbing examples yet of journalistic license for profit. 
There is a huge difference between using data to track the activities of known virus positive people going out from quarantine against the mandated rules for them (which is wonderful and should be done without exception), and people showing up in proximity to others, for example going shopping at a supermarket or at a pharmacy. The weakness of the rules is that endless exceptions exist such as necessary shopping, therefore the numbers of people to monitor ALL data and decipher what has meaning and what doesn't, is endless.
We simply need to ankle bracelet every positive testing person, monitoring the h out of those,  and eliminate these silly smartphone articles."

8.31E+12,Dave Hanson,Well that's the downside of living in a complex society-sometimes personal freedoms have to take a hit for the overall good.
5.84E+12,Paul Rivett,I'll drive around in a Model T to avoid technology if I have to.
6.46E+12,Ben Brown,A very harpereque musing by lil potato
7.69E+12,Andre Longstock,"Sure, lets create a bureaucracy to track cell phones. What a joke this guy is."
9.72E+12,Roger Stanley,"Many posters are calling out Justin for what they believe is an infringement on their privacy.  Quick CBC, protect your man, deflect and run a story telling everyone that Andrew Scheer is an American."
7.39E+12,David Fairbairn,"Yikes! The ""You're not the boss of me"" generation have moved out and are now free to roam."
3.56E+12,Eevee Frost,"That's the great thing about elections. When you win, you get to run stuff."
8.20E+12,Eevee Frost,"That's the great thing about elections.  When you win, you get to run stuff.  If you dislike please vote again in 3.5 years.  Until then, blah blah blah."
6.13E+12,Paul Rivett,Another reason to laugh at him.
6.93E+12,Arnold Ziffel,"this  might  work  for  millennial's,    they   have  panic  attacks  3  min  away  from their  i-phones"
1.21E+12,Louis Pelt,"Over the years, China has received more UN awards than any other nation. Their central governance and command structure is routinely held up as a model for others. It is intentional, and it is working."
5.56E+12,Eevee Frost,Funny no one said anything when Harper sent the EI cops to spy on people. Funny that.  Conservatives loved that.
1.35E+12,Jim Redmond,I'll just leave my phone at home when I break curfew.
1.01E+13,Eevee Frost,Trudeau has done an excellent job handling this.  Reformers going to reform no matter what he does so pay no mind to them.
5.30E+12,Alain Delon,"make no mistake, if this is ever implemented, we will be tracked forever. 
politicians like knowing what their voters do"
1.08E+13,Roger Stanley,"Can you imagine if it was a Conservative saying this, any conservative?  The MSM and it's lemming followers would be in a tither."
5.76E+12,Darren MacDonald,"Instead of tracking my data, how about working on that 25% discount you promised."
2.18E+12,Ben Brown,Finally some Lib plan Con likes.
1.01E+13,Luc Newsome,It won’t happen.......but it’s fun to kick around the idea
9.07E+12,Mark Sobkow,"'cause no one could ever think of leaving their phone home for a change, could they? :("
1.09E+13,Mick Murcatto,The fact that he thinks this is a reflection of his appreciation and respect for China and Cuba.
2.61E+12,Eevee Frost,"It doesn't matter what J.T. does, the right is going to right.  It's what they do."
1.53E+12,Luc Newsome,It’s always a good way to get people to do the opposite
1.72E+12,Peter Weber,Turn off your location on your smart phones as government  will snoop on you to see if you obey their rules
5.86E+12,Nicholas Jones,Couldn't get dictatorial powers with the budget so has to go and play Big Brother.
1.05E+13,Dan McIntyre,"Toss privacy out the window, the libbies need to know."
3.74E+12,Patrick Richard in QC (AKA Patrick Richard),"If you don't want to be tracked, get off the Internet right now; no mobile, no computer, no Alexa or equivalent, etc.
No Facebook,  no Twitter,  no online purchases, etc."
2.32E+12,Harold Peters,So the great Charter of Rights means absolutely nothing.
1.81E+12,Eevee Frost,I see the reformers have logged in.
1.54E+12,Denny O'Brien,If people werent stupid he wouldnt have to.
7.56E+12,steve stevens,"So they are wasting time looking at cell data ? Awesome, how about sending some nurses and doctors to replace the ones droppoing like flies."
1.36E+12,Fred Funk,"Well, what do you expect? You don't comply with the public good, then there are consequences."
4.07E+12,Denny O'Brien,How are this many people this stupid?
7.14E+12,Patrick Blois,Orwellian stuff
6.21E+12,Alan Smithee,Welcome to the Surveillance State.
1.02E+13,Harold Peters,Is this for real?
3.05E+12,Robert Ross,"If you agreed on a Kiosk that you will self isolate for 14 day after returning to Canada, and you break that agreement, you should pay for any health care required to treat the ones you infect.

Look, the government is doing as much as they can to keep as many people safe as they can, and to bring these people home from abroad (including those who were stupid enough to leave in the midst of this outbreak out of concern of losing their money), they need these people to do their part.

If you don't want to do your part, then you should pay your fair share for contributing to the problems you create.

The sooner we get through this short term pain, the quicker we are to getting back to (some sort of) normality. 

The USA, on the other hand, seemed doomed now."
1.09E+13,Ron Haverkamp,Funny how people will give up personal freedom for the illusion the government will save them. Look what they tried this morning with the unlimited tax and spend bill. Our society has become incredibly soft. I wonder what the vets of ww1 and ww2 would say
2.79E+12,James Ruslin,"So the people cheering this had better enjoy the Chinese style social credit system it will spawn. These sorts of power grabs never recede, they only expand."
3.99E+12,Franklin Steeple,Never let a good crisis go to waste hey Trudoh?
8.45E+12,Luc Newsome,Urban city residents aka liberal voters......don’t like this
3.44E+12,Will Fields,There is some historical justification for mistrusting intrusions initially done for good reason in the public interest that never seem to be reset all the way back after the initial need arose.  The most infamous example being the federal income tax imposed to fight WW1.
9.93E+12,Chris Vickers,I often go out without my phone but I am not a phone junkie. I know some who are phone junkies.
1.03E+13,Sukhbir Powar,Forcing people to stay home as the economy is shut down is a good way to quell social unrest.
1.02E+13,Luc Newsome,Fine the people......of course....they are broke and unemployed
9.63E+12,Will Fields,Curses!  Foiled by a text message.
1.09E+13,mike kennedy,By his 3rd term Justin would be open to implanting microchips in Canadians.
4.08E+12,Ben Brown,"Con are a strange lot
When Harper was angling to grab civil liberties they were all goo-stepping in favour. 
Truds seems to think that violators will need their phones to go to house parties."
1.12E+12,Sharon Harrison,"Cell phone usage has been used in cases where patients have died or tested positive in order to track where they have been and who may have been affected.  Why does this bother people?   I'm all for privacy, not a Liberal or Conservative fan ... but do what has to be done to make stupid people pay attention."
1.52E+12,Sue Dow,"When I go golfing with my 3 buddies do we now need 4 golf carts?
Have you seen how people pack into the gondola at Mont Tremblant or Whistler?"
5.67E+12,Jennie Wing,Pravda Canada busy censoring and deleting.  They really don't like us remembering who flew to the UK and back and was then diagnosed with the coronavirus.
5.02E+12,Sidney Watts,I would support this for people who have been told to self isolate or those who have tested positive and told to self quarantine.
4.91E+12,Richard Dekkar,"No surprise really, he did try to sneak his dictatorial spending spree through so monitoring Canadians’ individual whereabouts would be perfectly inline with the inspiration he declared he gets from Communist China."
4.93E+12,Luc Newsome,This guy is never straight with Canadians
6.25E+12,patrick morris,"My daughter lives near Cornwall, Ont. She tells me local residents are upset with recently returned snowbirds camped out in their RV's who aren't self-isolating for 14 days.  Prime Minister Trudeau shouldn't have encouraged them to return home."
4.88E+12,James Lockheed,"Big brother is watching 

Always watching 

And it’s propaganda machine the CBC"
9.51E+12,Jennie Wing,I guess I should read Revelations to refresh  my mind on how this all ends again.....
6.00E+12,Sam Sharpe,"Those who gather in groups are selfish and seem not to have regard for others who may be seriously affected by their actions.  On the other hand if we open this Pandora box of using smartphone data in this way as public policy (yep I am aware the security services use this today), we might regret when the inevitable mis-use occurs.  There are surveillance cameras everywhere surely having a peek at those would do the same trick."
6.46E+12,Franklin Steeple,"A cbc fan will be along shortly to explain how this is a good thing and how privacy is only a ""privilege"". Also, freedoms were only created by old dead w hi Te guys and they need to be removed when times get tough."
9.40E+12,Aaron Barton,Remember how many liberal heads exploded when Harper even thought about touching privacy laws.
8.76E+12,Malcolm Scott,Well....just don't take your phone with you.....
1.71E+12,Patrick Richard in QC (AKA Patrick Richard),"Questionable behaviour by some will bring enforcement to all.

Personally I believe in targeted enforcement. The two main parties want more surveillance of all citizens."
5.43E+12,steve jackson,"Justin will likely exploit the crisis situation to acquire as much power as he can.  We've already see this today, so considering the Orwellian measures this article is suggesting the Prime Minister is also thinking about fits into Justin's MO well."
9.03E+12,James Ruslin,"Anybody who cheers this sort of dystopian surveillance power grab is an enemy of freedom.
Once granted this sort of Big Brother monitoring never recedes it only ever expands."
1.73E+12,Jennie Wing,I don't have a smartphone.  So the little dictator can't track me.
6.98E+12,Franklin Steeple,Leave your phone at home if you need to collect rats and cats and squirrels for stew this summer.
3.63E+12,Brad Calbick,"While I am angered by those who have no regard for the safety of others and are selfish enough to just trod onward with their lives like nothing is happening, I do not support this idea. Turn that feature on and you'll never be able to turn it off again....all in the greater public good of course"
1.07E+13,Jim Blackstock,"I would be very cool with that.

The medical community is pleading for people to abide by the requests, but a significant number refuse to do so.

Take their names when they congregate, track down cell numbers, then monitor as they deem necessary.

Same thing with anyone coming into the country.  Monitor for 14 days.  

Yeah, yeah . . . . games could be played by shuffling phones about, but let's be honest: most hold phone dear to their life."
4.82E+12,Tori Boucher,Can you also look into my house with the technology I don't know about?
3.60E+12,Garry williams,what happens if you forget your cell phone at home??
1.44E+12,Franklin Steeple,"Welcome to the NWO! Does he want us chipped too?

Ooops my 'stupid phone' just fell in the lake!"
5.99E+12,Graeme Duke-Gibbs,Why not use debit and credit card purchases?
7.39E+12,Martin Caine,"Finally a good use for all those gadgets. It worked in Wuhan, Taiwan and Singapore."
